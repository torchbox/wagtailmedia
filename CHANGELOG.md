`BaseMediaChooserPanel` is deprecated, and will be removed in a future release. Please use `AdminMediaChooser` instead ([#40](https://github.com/torchbox/wagtailmedia/pull/40)):

```diff
- from wagtailmedia.edit_handlers import BaseMediaChooserPanel
+ from wagtailmedia.edit_handlers import MediaChooserPanel

# [...]

content_panels = Page.content_panels + [
    # [...]
-    BaseMediaChooserPanel('video_media'),
+    MediaChooserPanel('video_media'),
    # [...]
```
